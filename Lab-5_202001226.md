### ***Understanding of errors***
* **As per the above photo, all 6 errors are of the importing modules which means mypy was able to find the module i was importing, but no corresponding type hints.** <br>
* **There are also 3 notes in the analysis. According to me, those notes is for hints or better implementations or some suggestions.**
* **In the 3rd note it is also giving commands to install missing stub packages.** <br>
